React: The core library for building the user interface. It helps us create reusable UI components, manage component states, and handle events.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Itâ€™s highly customizable and has in-built responsive design functionalities.

Prisma: An open-source database toolkit. It's used as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to perform database operations, providing an abstraction to interact with MongoDB.

MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database used for storing our application's data in a flexible, JSON-like format.

NextAuth: A complete full-stack authentication solution for Next.js applications. It offers a zero-compromise solution that can support email/password, OAuth, and many other login strategies.
